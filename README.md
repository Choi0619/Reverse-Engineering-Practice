# Reverse Engineering

## Description
This repository demonstrates the process of **reverse engineering** an Android APK file, specifically **wargame.apk**. The process involves extracting and analyzing the contents of the APK to understand its structure and inner workings.

### Folder Structure:
- **2**: Initial steps of reverse engineering, where the APK begins to be deconstructed.
- **3**: Further breakdown of the APK, showing more detailed components.
- **4**: Contains the **Java source code** extracted from the APK, providing insights into the application's logic after fully decompiling the contents.

- **META-INF**: Includes the APK's metadata.
- **res**: Resources used by the APK (e.g., images, layouts).
- **AndroidManifest.xml**: The APK's manifest file, defining essential app information.
- **classes.dex**: The compiled Dalvik bytecode for the application.
- **resources.arsc**: The compiled resources for the app.
- **7za.exe**: Utility used for extracting the contents of the APK.
